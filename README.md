A litle site about why Copyright laws are good.
<br
<p>Copyright laws are good because they protect artists. Without them, ideas would simply be stolen and profited off of without the original author's consent. Copyright laws exist to keep people from stealing someone else's idea and claiming it as their own.</p>
